Polarized Reflectivity: Gepore Validation
==========================================
We will use the `gepore.f` program (Fortran77), as published in the PNR book chapter to validate
the results of Refl1D calculations.

For models expected Zeeman corrections 
(with large applied field `H` and non-zero in-plane component of `M` perpendicular to `H`), 
we will use the version `gepore_zeeman.f` which was created when the JAC article on the Zeeman-corrected
neutron reflectivity calculation was published. (include link to JAC article here)
